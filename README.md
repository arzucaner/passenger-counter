# Passenger Counter
---

**This is a JavaScript project that allows you to count the number of passengers in a vehicle. It includes a simple interface with buttons for incrementing and decrementing the passenger count, as well as a reset button to start over.

The passenger count is displayed in real-time as you click the buttons, making it easy to keep track of how many people are in the vehicle.
